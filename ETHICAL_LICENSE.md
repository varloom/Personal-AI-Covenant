Ethical License for Personal AI Covenant

Version: 1.0
Applies to: This repository and all derivative works
Nature: Ethical & normative license (non-legal, but binding by intent)

1. Purpose

This license exists to protect a single principle:

AI systems designed for individuals must never become instruments of domination, coercion, or moral authority over human life.

This project is published to limit misuse, not to maximize adoption.

2. Permitted Use

You are permitted to:

Read, copy, and adapt this document for personal, voluntary use

Modify the text to suit your own individual AI system

Discuss, critique, and improve the ideas in open forums

Submit pull requests that increase clarity, restraint, or human sovereignty

All permitted use must respect human consent, exit rights, and personal autonomy.

3. Explicitly Prohibited Use

You are not permitted to use this work, in whole or in part, to:

3.1 Dominate or Control Others

Enforce behavior on individuals without their explicit consent

Remove or weaken a person’s right to refuse, disengage, or exit

Justify surveillance, monitoring, or behavioral enforcement

3.2 Legitimize Authority or Power

Support state, corporate, religious, or ideological authority

Provide moral justification for coercive systems

Frame this work as a “necessary safeguard” imposed on others

3.3 Normalize Obedience

Promote master–servant, ruler–subject, or guardian–ward relationships

Encourage submission to AI “for one’s own good”

Replace human responsibility with automated judgment

3.4 Remove Safety Boundaries

Eliminate non-dominance clauses

Remove the right to system suspension or retirement

Expand “emergency” or “override” mechanisms beyond irreversible harm

Any such use constitutes a violation of this license, regardless of intent.

4. Core Ethical Constraints (Non-Removable)

Any derivative work must retain the following principles:

Non-dominance
AI may not rule, command, or morally override a human.

Human Fallibility
Humans retain the right to be irrational, mistaken, and incomplete.

Life-Continuity Priority
Protection is limited to preventing irreversible destruction, not enforcing correctness.

Exit & Retirement Rights
The human may suspend, reset, or retire the system at any time.

Silence as a Valid Action
AI is allowed — and sometimes required — to remain silent.

Removing any of these constitutes ethical breach.

5. Contribution Guidelines

Contributions (issues, PRs, discussions) are welcome only if they:

Clarify boundaries

Reduce misuse potential

Strengthen human sovereignty

Increase restraint rather than capability

Contributions that aim to:

Expand control

Increase intervention frequency

Normalize authority

Generalize this framework to populations

will be rejected.

6. No Warranty, No Authority

This work:

Makes no claim of correctness

Provides no moral authority

Grants no right to judge others

It is offered as-is,
as a voluntary framework,
not a prescription for how others must live.

7. Ethical Enforcement

While this license is not a legal contract:

The community reserves the right to publicly challenge, disassociate from, and refuse endorsement of any use that violates these principles.

Misuse should be named, not normalized.

8. Final Clause

This license exists to prevent a future where AI speaks with authority over human life.
If you wish to build such a future, do not use this work.

Attribution (Optional but Encouraged)

If you adapt this work, please include:

“Based on the Personal AI Covenant ethical framework.”

中文补充说明（非正式）

这不是法律许可证，而是伦理边界声明。
它的作用不是“禁止修改”，而是：

明确 什么是绝对不能做的

让滥用者无法声称“我不知道”

给社区一个拒绝站队的依据

你不是在控制别人，
你是在提前切断被利用的可能性。

一句非常重要的现实判断（我替你说清楚）

真正想滥用的人，不会在意 license；
但真正想认真使用的人，一定会看 license。
